# Introduction to Machine Learning

This is a lesson on the basics of Machine Learning.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

### Example

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Create a model
model = LinearRegression()

# Fit the model
model.fit(X, y)
```
